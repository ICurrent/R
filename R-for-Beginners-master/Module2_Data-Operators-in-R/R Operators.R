#=================================== Operators in R ==================================================

# There are four main categories of Operators in R programming language.
#1. Arithmetic Operators 2.Relational Operators 3.Logical Operators 4.Assignment Operators

# --------------------------------------- 1. Arithmetic Operators --------------------------------
#  Arithmetic Operators are used to accomplish arithmetic operations.

# R Arithmetic Operators Example for integers
a <- 7.5
b <- 2

print ( a+b ) #addition
print ( a-b ) #subtraction
print ( a*b ) #multiplication
print ( a/b ) #Division
print ( a%%b ) #Reminder
print ( a%/%b ) #Quotient
print ( a^b ) #Power of


# R Operators - R Arithmetic Operators Example for vectors

a <- c(8, 9, 6)
b <- c(2, 4, 5)

print ( a+b ) #addition
print ( a-b ) #subtraction
print ( a*b ) #multiplication
print ( a/b ) #Division
print ( a%%b ) #Reminder
print ( a%/%b ) #Quotient
print ( a^b ) #Power of

#------------------------------------- 2.Relational Operators --------------------------------------
# Relational Operators are those that find out relation between the two operands provided to them.
# The output is boolean (TRUE or FALSE) for all of the Relational Operators in R programming language.

# R Operators - R Relational Operators Example for Numbers

a <- 7.5
b <- 2

print ( a<b ) # less than
print ( a>b ) # greater than
print ( a==b ) # equal to
print ( a<=b ) # less than or equal to
print ( a>=b ) # greater than or equal to
print ( a!=b ) # not equal to


# R Operators - R Relational Operators Example for Numbers

a <- c(7.5, 3, 5)
b <- c(2, 7, 0)

print ( a<b ) # less than
print ( a>b ) # greater than
print ( a==b ) # equal to
print ( a<=b ) # less than or equal to
print ( a>=b ) # greater than or equal to
print ( a!=b ) # not equal to


# ---------------------------------- 3.Logical Operators -----------------------------------------

# Logical Operators in R programming language work only for the basic data types logical, numeric and complex and vectors of these basic data types.

# R Operators - R Logical Operators Example for basic logical elements

a <- 0 # logical FALSE
b <- 2 # logical TRUE

print ( a & b ) # logical AND element wise
print ( a | b ) # logical OR element wise
print ( !a ) # logical NOT element wise
print ( a && b ) # logical AND consolidated for all elements
print ( a || b ) # logical OR consolidated for all elements


# R Operators - R Logical Operators Example for boolean vectors

a <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
b <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

print ( a & b ) # logical AND element wise
print ( a | b ) # logical OR element wise
print ( !a ) # logical NOT element wise
print ( a && b ) # logical AND consolidated for all elements
print ( a || b ) # logical OR consolidated for all elements


# ----------------------------------------- 4.Assignment Operators ---------------------------------
# Assignment Operators are those that help in assigning a value to the variable.

# R Operators - R Assignment Operators

a = 2
print ( a )

a <- TRUE
print ( a )

454 -> a
print ( a )

a <<- 2.9
print ( a )

c(6, 8, 9) -> a
print ( a )


# ----------------------------------------- R Miscellaneous Operators -----------------------------
# These operators does not fall into any of the categories mentioned above, but are significantly important during R programming for manipulating data.

# R Operators - R Misc Operators

a = 23:31 # Creates series of numbers from left operand to right operand
print ( a )

a = c(25, 27, 76) # Identifies if an element(a) belongs to a vector(b)
b = 27
print ( b %in% a )

M = matrix(c(1,2,3,4), 2, 2, TRUE) # Performs multiplication of a vector with its transpose

print ( M %*% t(M) )
